"Random number generators (RNGs) are a crucial part of many different computer software processes, such as cryptography, simulations, machine learning, gaming, programming, gambling, scientific studies, and the list goes on. But you might ask how exactly do you make something random, and why is it so important?
It turns out that computers are not very good at being spontaneous â€“ they can only perform what you program them to do. RNGs give computers the ability to generate unique non-uniform numbers. In other words, RNGs let computers simulate unpredictability." [1]
