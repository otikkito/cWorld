    Check and sanitize your inputs;
    Protect your routine from bad data. No "garbage in, garbage out";
    Use assertions to document pre-conditions and post-conditions;
    Standardize exception handling on your code;
    Consider not using exceptions for everything - you can handle errors in
    another way, the programming world existed prior exceptions were invented;
    Debugging and assertions help you during development, and most (but not all) of 
    the debug/assertions must be disabled in production code;
