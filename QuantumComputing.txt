"Chemical engineers, for example, are anticipating that quantum computers will 
be able to simulate large and complex molecules to predict the combinations that
will best fight off disease in order to create life-saving drugs much faster;
 banking giants are counting on quantum systems to determine the best stocks to 
 buy and sell for maximum return, based on calculations that can account for 
 any more fast-changing factors; and car manufacturers are testing how the 
 technology could revolutionise the design of batteries, the optimisation of 
 supply chains or the management of traffic in dense, urban settings."
