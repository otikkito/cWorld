break | Passes control out of the compound statement.
case | Branches control.
char | Basic data types (integer and character).
const | Makes variable value or pointer parameter unmodifiable.

c program basically consists of the following parts:
-Preprocessor commands/directives :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor
-Functions : https://github.com/otikkito/cWorld/blob/master/functions.c
-Variables
-Statements
-Expressions 
-Comments : Use the /**/ comment style do to comiler warning which we are trying to minimize
