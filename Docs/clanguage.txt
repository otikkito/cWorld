c keywords
------------
auto |Defines a local variable as having a local lifetime. Storage class
break | Passes control out of the compound statement. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_break_statement.htm
case | Branches control.
char | Basic data types (integer and character).
const | Makes variable value or pointer parameter unmodifiable.
continue | Passes control to the beginning of the loop.
default | Branches control.
do | Do-while loop.
double |Floating point data types.
else | Conditional statement.
enum | Defines a set of constants of type int.
extern | Indicates that an identifier is defined elsewhere.
float | Floating point data types.
for | For loop.
goto | Unconditionally transfer control.
if | Conditional statement.
int | Basic data types (integer and character).
long | Type modifiers.
register | Tells the compiler to store the variable being declared in a CPU register.
return | Exits the function.
short | Type modifiers.
signed | Type modifiers.
sizeof | Returns the size of the expression or type. Returns the size in bytes.
static | Preserves variable value to survive after its scope ends. Can be used for both data and functions
struct | Groups variables into a single record.
switch | Branches control.
typedef | Creates a new type.q
union | Groups variables which share the same storage space.
unsigned | Type modifiers.
void | Empty data type.
volatile | Indicates that a variable can be changed by a background routine
while | Repeats execution while the condition is true.

c program basically consists of the following parts:
-Preprocessor commands/directives :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor
-Functions : https://github.com/otikkito/cWorld/blob/master/functions.c
-Variables
-Statements
-Expressions 
-Comments : Use the /**/ comment style to prevent compiler warnings which we are trying to minimize

#TODO ADD examples of all the keywords
http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html

C programming paradigm: imperative and procedural 

"The natural abstraction is the procedure"
procedure: A set of instructions that perform a specific task; a subroutine or function.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)
"Abstracts one or more actions to a procedure, which can be called as a single command."
http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/prog3-03/html/notes/paradigms_themes-paradigm-overview-section.html

TODO
1) explain structures and type definition
2) math behind looping and asymptotic complexity
3) preprocessor commands and compiler options
4) Type up and summarize key concepts that I don't unnderstand
5)
